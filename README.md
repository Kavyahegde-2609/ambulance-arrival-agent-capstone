# Ambulance Arrival Agent – Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This capstone project explores the concept of predicting or simulating ambulance
arrival behavior using a rule-based or agent-based approach. The project was developed
to understand system logic, decision flow, and basic AI-agent concepts.

## Objectives
- Learn agent-based system concepts
- Understand decision-making workflows
- Apply AI concepts at a conceptual level

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- AI-assisted logic
- Simulation concepts

## Project Type
Capstone Project for 5 days AI Agent course from kaggle

## Scope
- Conceptual and educational
- Focus on understanding logic, not real-world deployment

## Disclaimer
This project is strictly for academic learning purposes.
It is not a real emergency response system and should not
be used in real-life scenarios.

## Academic Note
The project was developed with the assistance of AI tools
and open-source references to understand agent-based logic
and system behavior.
